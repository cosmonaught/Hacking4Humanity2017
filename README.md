## EmpowHerSF 
Check out the project index [here](web/index.html) 

Our project focuses on providing awareness and funding to local SF area shelters. We narrowed down the donations to three areas - underwear, feminine hygiene, and money - for locals to donate and by choosing one and the donate button it will bring you to a page to donate to a local shelter that needs one of those options.
